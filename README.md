| [Workflow-1: Automating OBS Recordings with Calendar Integration, Transcription, and Insight Extraction](https://github.com/script-repo/EDC-GenAI/tree/main/workshop/WF-1) | This workflow automates the process of managing `.mkv` files generated by OBS, combining PowerShell scripts to rename files based on Outlook Calendar events, organize them, convert them to `.mp3`, and transcribe the audio to text using Whisper CLI. It then extracts actionable insights from the transcriptions with Fabric's `extract_wisdom` pattern. This end-to-end automation ensures your recordings are named, structured, and processed, allowing you to easily organize, transcribe, and derive valuable insights from your audio files. |
